# History of JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world today, especially for web development. Here's a look at its fascinating journey.

---

## - 1. The Birth of JavaScript (1995)

- JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** in **just 10 days** in May 1995.
- It was originally named **Mocha**, later renamed **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.
- Developed at **Netscape** for use in their browser **Netscape Navigator**.
- Despite the name, JavaScript is **not related to Java** — the name was marketing-driven.

---

## - 2. Standardization (1996–1997)

- To ensure consistent behavior across browsers, JavaScript was submitted for standardization.
- In 1997, **ECMAScript** was born, a standardized version of JavaScript by **ECMA International**.
- The first edition was published as **ECMA-262**.

## - 3. Browser Wars & Growth (Late 1990s – 2000s)

- Microsoft created its own version called **JScript** for Internet Explorer.
- This led to fragmentation and inconsistencies across browsers.
- JavaScript evolved slowly during this period due to lack of standard updates.

---

## - 4. The Rise of Modern JavaScript (2009–2015)

- **Node.js** was released in **2009**, bringing JavaScript to the server-side.
- JavaScript gained popularity outside the browser for backend development.
- In **2015**, **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)** was released:
  - Introduced `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, promises, modules, and more.
  - Marked a major turning point for JavaScript's capabilities.

## - 5. JavaScript Today

- JavaScript is maintained and updated regularly through **ECMAScript** versions (ES7, ES8, etc.).
- Supported by all modern browsers.
- Core to frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Angular**, and runtime environments like **Node.js**.
- Integral to front-end, back-end, full-stack, mobile, and even desktop app development.

- **1997** – Standardized as ECMAScript  
- **2009** – Node.js released  
- **2015+** – Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond)  
- **Today** – Used everywhere from browsers to servers to apps
